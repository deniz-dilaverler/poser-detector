# Poser Detector!

This is a submission for Hackathon With Lewis. <br/>
Poser Detector is a website that sells merch of your favorite bands! Simple, right? <br/> However, it is functional only if you are a true fan and know 5 of the songs of the band you want to buy merch from.
So, we could say, <i>FUNCTIONALLY DYSFUNCTIONAL</i> in a sense.
